# Library specification

## Input evidence

The caller supplies evidence that has already been reconstructed and validated by an evidence reader. Each source contains `id`, `label`, `fingerprint`, and `evidence`. Identities and content fingerprints are unique among supplied sources.

The `evidence` object contains these collections:

| Collection | Records |
| --- | --- |
| `runs` | Test runs containing their original `id`. |
| `sequences` | Test sequences containing `id` and their parent `test_run`. |
| `observations` | Original observations, including `recorded_state`, widgets, capture status, and available actions. |
| `actions` | Original action descriptions. |
| `executions` | Records containing `execution`, `status`, and, when recorded, `resultingObservation`. |

`execution` contains the original action execution: its `id`, `test_sequence`, `source_observation`, `action_description`, `target_widget`, and `parameters`. Statuses retain the evidence terminology, including `awaiting_execution_result` and `awaiting_resulting_observation`.

Collections use arrays of records. Python also accepts dictionaries indexed by record identity. The shared conformance input uses this same collection structure. An original JSONL trace must first be read by its evidence library; it is different from this reconstructed input.

## Group observations

Rules select state properties, widget properties, filtering, hierarchy, order, and string normalization. The preview contains the applied `definition`, `policyFingerprint`, `interpreterVersion`, `inputScope`, `groups`, and `unmatched` observations.

Each group retains compared values, observation references, and `widgetCorrespondences`. Repeated matching widgets in one observation make the correspondence ambiguous. An observation with missing required values or unsuitable comparison values retains its reference and an explanation in `unmatched`.

## Construct the model

Model construction verifies the original source fingerprints and selected runs. The result contains:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `nodes` | Abstract states with their original observation members; unmatched observations have their own node and explanation. |
| `edges` | Executed transitions and separate observation-order links. Each edge retains supporting execution or observation references. |
| `unlinkedExecutions` | Executions without a completed connection, retaining their original status and an explanation. |
| `actionEvidence` | Present when action rules are supplied. Contains abstract actions, availability, execution relationships, ambiguity, and unmatched action records. |

Action matching stays within each abstract source state. Recorded availability links remain available when actual input differs from the planned value. An action without a matching execution retains the availability evidence; its outcome remains unknown.

Inputs remain unchanged. Returned records are independent copies. Generated identifiers connect records within the constructed result; cross-language verification compares memberships and supporting references.

## Implementation responsibilities

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `engine` | Apply rules to selected observations and retain groups, widget correspondences, and unmatched explanations. |
| `model` | Verify the preview's evidence scope and construct transitions and observation-order links. |
| `rules` / `fields` | Validate definitions, select properties, and transform comparison values. |
| `projection` | Filter widgets and compare flat collections or parent-child hierarchies. |
| `index` | Find selected runs and source-qualified evidence records. |
| `actions` | Match availability and executions while retaining ambiguity and recorded links. |
| `common` | Comparison identities, errors, and accumulated processing budgets. |

The public API coordinates these responsibilities. Processing follows the limits and semantics defined in the [shared specification](https://github.com/ferpasri/testar-abstraction-specs/blob/main/docs/SPEC.md).

Rule or scope errors reject the operation. Processing-budget exhaustion also rejects the operation. Unsuitable observation or action values produce unmatched records with explanations.
